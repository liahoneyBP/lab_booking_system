#### Problem
Conventional lab room reservations such as how to record a reservation in a document or a user must book directly through the administrator. Causing many times to change the date and time may be inconvenient and may cause mistakes or booking duplicate and overlapping booking rooms.
or have made a reservation and haven't used it yet let various possibilities let others Lose the chance at that Lab.
#### Solution
The development of web -application Lab room reservations helps to reduce such errors as it allows administrators to view various booking information, and user can view information Schedule the availability of the room. via web application making it possible for anyone to check the lab usage schedule
Including the date and time of use and booking a lab by yourself

- Prevent duplicate bookings for dates/times
- Work with Scheduler Library with bookings data
- Scan Check-In with Qr-Code
###  Future Developments
- Maximum book of user
- Dynamic add book scheduled class by admin
